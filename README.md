# ERC20 token-distribution

This repo contains my research and implementation of how Uniswap technically solved its UNI (an ERC20) token distribution.
It contains a script that can be used to check if an address or list of addresses can claim an erc20.

### Running the script

```
git clone https://github.com/chefking/token-distribution

cd token-distribution

yarn
```
